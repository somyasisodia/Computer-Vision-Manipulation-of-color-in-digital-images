Other Decisions :

1. During calculations, all the denominators other than direct numeric digits are checked at all the stages to not make the result NaN or indefinite.
2. The range of L is ensured is between 0 and 100.
3. At all stages, it is ensured that float doesn't convert to int or vice-versa wherevernot required.
4. It has been made sure to convert float digits to round or floor or int wherever required.
